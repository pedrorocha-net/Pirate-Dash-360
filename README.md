## Inspiration

As recent unversity graduates, each of us are soon to embark on our career journey. Inevitably, looking back and reflecting has been part of preparation for the journey ahead. We thought of instances that has propelled us into the world of technology, some highlights include physical puzzle games like Rush Hour, Circuit Maze and Carcasonne. These brain stimulating games has indeed formed the foundations behind our technology backgrounds, as they served to strengthen our **logical thinking aptitude, planning, memory and problem solving skills**.

As a team, we wanted to **pay it forward and contribute to society**, especially in the **education space**. We wanted to do so through a fun and fuss free medium, after all learning is most productive when it is fun! While doing so, we intended to incoporate elements of **cutting edge technology** in today's society. Furthermore, during this period, where many of us are encountering various forms of lockdown in our respective countries due to COVID-19, we come to understand that certain parents are finding it difficult to keep their children occupied, we wanted to implement a solution which helps to solve this problem productively. Through these, **PirateDash360** was born.

**PirateDash360** recreate this 360 degrees, immersive puzzle experience for our future generation through an Augmented Reality (AR) game that we have conceived through several rounds of ideation. We hope that through **PirateDash360**, users can strengthen their logical thinking aptitude, planning, memory, as well as problem solving skills in a fun manner. We also hope that that this game would serve as a productive form of entertainment and education for children during this trying period, and of course, beyond that as well.

## What it does

**PirateDash360** is a 360 degrees augmented reality game which brings the player into the world of hunting treasure chests through solving puzzles. Players are tasked to formulate a path which leads the pirate from the starting tile to the end tile, where the treasure is located, while avoiding various traps and obstacles. This is done through swapping directional tiles. Through this game, we hope to strengthen the player's logical thinking, as there are multiple ways that the user can formulate the answer to the puzzle.

Currently, **PirateDash360** guides our player with our very own true treasure hunting journey,and comprise two worlds with five levels in each world, featuring different themes (GrassLand and Snow World), settings, traps, obstacles, tile variations and many more!

## How we built it
The backbone of **PirateDash360** was built with Spark AR Studio. We experimented with both the patch editor as well as scripting, and utilises element in both, with most of the elements done via scripting. We also made use of Spark AR's native picker and particle systems, amongst other Spark AR Studio's features utilised. Assets such as 3D objects, images and sounds were carefully curated through multiple sources to project a unified and natural experience.

## Challenges we ran into
As most of us were new to the realms of augmented reality, as well as game programming, we had to learn Spark AR from scratch. Fortunately, the tutorials were informative and provided us with what we needed to complete our game. Some of our main challenges include the following:

- Sourcing and curation of assets that were within our stipulated budget, whilst maintaining required size requirement for deployment of **PirateDash360** on Instagram.

- Our lack of knowledge on 3D modelling and animation concepts such as blending, cull and animation curves made it difficult for us to configure the aesthetics of our game in the earlier weeks. Despite multiple attempts, we were not able to do due to time constraint and bandwidth limitations. We decided to utilise the wealth of resources available from third parties such as SketchFab.

- While we used scripting to create most of our animations, we were not able to change the animation controller attached to our 3D objects without the Patch Editor. We managed to integrate the script and Patch Editor via passing of variables, but the Option Picker was limited to only 5 options, and hence, we could not fully utilise the range of animations of our objects.

- We had multiple ambitious ideas around the usage of AR during our planning stage, but many proved infeasible due to the size limit. However, this is fully understandable and we are glad to have overcame this challenge toward the end.

- Some of us concurred on the initial learning curve of the patch editor for animation tweaks, this was resolved over time through practice, and we realised the immense equity that it provides for developers.

- We had issues with positioning and piecing together assets in the World View, as we were pretty new to AR technology, this got better over time, through practice and playing around with the different toolings available in Spark AR Studio.

## Accomplishments that weâ€™re proud of
Overall, We are very satisfied with our end result, and only wished we had more time to implement more features for our users. That being said, we are are really proud of what we have done as a team. Through **PirateDash360**, we believe we can deliver on our intentions and goals as highlighted above! More details on our accomplishments and plans can be found in the next section.

## What we learned
We learnt so much regarding Spark AR Studio and how scripting can be used to enhance the overall AR experience. Through our various brainstorming and ideation sessions, we learnt that that there are endless possibilities when it comes to AR, and can be leveraged in many settings including, but not limited to education and gaming. Some key learning points include:

- Learnt about how animations work and how they can be created in Spark AR with the Patch Editor.

- Learnt how to create Spark AR projects and script using Javascript with reactive programming.

- Learnt about UI/UX, theming and AB Testing, through this, we were able to piece together various curated UI assets, which helped us in conceptualising and theming of the game, thus, providing a natural and intuitive experience for our gamers.

- Learnt about the benefits of Augmented Reality and Education based Gaming, and how we could potentially bring across social good and value to the masses through cutting edge technology.

## What's next for PirateDash360
We have great plans for **PirateDash360**! We intend to add more world themes and levels, include new obstacles and more complexities into the game. We also want to make the game even more fun through our own novelty effects, such as the snow particle systems and animated clouds, essentially effects that can be built through Spark AR Studio. Beyond this, we also plan to introduce memory based elemented into the the game, such as an eight directional tile system as compared to our current four directional tile system. We also intend to introduce concealed tiles, introducing more memory intensive reuirements in the game. Look forward to our updates!
