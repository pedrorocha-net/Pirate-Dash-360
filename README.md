# Facebook Spark AR Hackathon: Pirate Themed AR Puzzle Game
*by Team CharizARds*

## Getting Started
[insert instructions on how to run the project]

## Inspiration
Before computer games, we used to play physical puzzle games like Rush Hour when we were young. They were brain stimulating games that helped us to strengthen our logical thinking, planning and problem solving skills. Therefore, we hope to recreate this experience for our future generations through augmented reality (AR), with a puzzle game that we have conceived through several rounds of ideation.

## What it does
Players are supposed to move the [object] from the start to the end. They have to swap the directional tiles in order to complete each puzzle. This game will help to strengthen the user’s logical thinking, as there are multiple ways a user can formulate the answer to the puzzle.

## How we built it
The game was built entirely using the Spark AR Studio. The main scripting done with JavaScript, and this set of code executes a set of commands based on the user’s swaps. Various game objects were sourced from different sites that provided game assets for free.

We created a few levels for our players, and they come in a 3 x 3 and a 4 x 4 grid. Players are required to swap the tiles within the time limit in order to complete the game successfully. Currently, these are the levels and puzzle types available to the players.

## Challenges we ran into
As we were new to the realms of augmented reality, we had to learn Spark AR from scratch. Fortunately, the tutorials were informative and provided us with what we needed to complete our game.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We were very satisfied with the end result, as we were total AR novices at the very beginning. We came up with a lot of items, including an interactive ocean, and eventually settled for this puzzle game after considering the various limitations that we encountered.

---
## What we learned
We learnt so much regarding Spark AR Studio! The patch editor can be very useful to achieve certain actions and effects. We are comfortable with creating our own Instagram filters now.

## What's next for Angry Bird Puzzle
Next, we plan to add in more tile types, such as distractors, and allow for different difficulty levels in the different grids.
